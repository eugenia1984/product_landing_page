# Product landing page
<p>After the FreeCodeCamp Course of Responsive Web Design I created a Product Landing Page with different sections, such as: features, how it´s works ans prices.</p>
<p> I added a video </p>
<p> And the footer can be linked to a contact information and terms and conditions</p>
